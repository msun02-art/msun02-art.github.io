        The AISense project raises a crucial question: Who represents technology, and what should technology be? 
        It challenges the conventional image of technological creation — a vision shaped by a small group of people 
        whose influence defines both the dominant aesthetic of cold, metallic precision and the operational logic 
        that underlies much of today’s technology. As artificial intelligence grows in complexity, it often continues 
        to mirror the perspectives of its makers while marginalizing other perspectives of sensing and understanding 
        the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        The AISense project begins by rethinking what an AI could be when imagined from the artist’s own perspective. 
        Instead of following familiar notions of machinery, cold precision, or human–machine hierarchy, the project 
        envisions an alternative form of intelligence: a being that blurs the boundary between plant and animal, 
        resembling an orchid whose petals take on the shape of attentive ears.
      </p>

      <p>
        This organism represents a more intimate and organic model of technology — one that grows, adapts, and forms 
        a shared ecosystem with the human rather than positioning itself as a tool. In this reimagined relationship, 
        technology becomes a companion that evolves alongside its user, suggesting a future in which AI is not 
        mechanical or distant, but living, responsive, and inherently connected.
